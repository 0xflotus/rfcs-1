# Summary

An important part of the Prisma developer experience is code generation. With code generation we're able to generate clients  for different languages, that ensure typesafe access to the Prisma API.

In this spec we propose how we can provide an easy to use generator API both for TypeScript and other languages to generate clients and how these generators can be plugged in into the Prisma workflow.



# Motivation

Prisma provides a higher abstraction level to connect to databases. While the core part of Prisma is the query engine, which transforms GraphQL queries into database queries, the other big part is the Prisma Client, which sends queries to the query engine.

The client consists of two major parts: The code gereration and the runtime. The runtime is very individual to the client API and has to be implemented based on the data access pattern that the client exposes. The active record pattern for example needs a completely different implementation than the data mapper pattern. However, both need code generation in order to provide type safety.

The input for these generators will be defined in the `prisma.yml` under the `generate` property. These inputs are then converted from YAML to JSON and passed in into the generators.

While having this generator API, it's important to notice, that we not only need to support generators written in TypeScript, but also generators writtten in languages like Go, Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

While you still can write a Java generator in TypeScript, many of these languages bring individual tools like [jennifer](https://github.com/dave/jennifer) for Go, that make code generation easier. In order to be able to leverage these tools, it must be possible to implement these generators in the target language.



# Detailed design

While we both want to support TypeScript and other languages as generator implementations, it's clear that we can't provide the same convenience for other languages as for TypeScript. As our CLI is also implemented in TypeScript, we can e.g. directly pass in a `graphql-js` schema object to the specific generator. This is not possible for the other languages, where we need to find a language agnostic format, which will be SDL. However, as TypeScript is a major use-case, it still makes sense to provide a dedicated TypeScript API while having a language-agnostic API as a fallback.

In the following we discuss how generators are being **configured** from the `prisma.yml` and how the **generator resolution** works. We will also explore, how the  **interface ** of a generator looks like, how a generator can be **packaged and installed** and how **arguments** can be passed in to a generator.

Until now, generators have only been responsible for generating the code, but not saving it to the filesystem. Non-TypeScript generators will be responsible for writing to the filesystem on their own. The TypeScript-based generators however will just need to return a Map of file name and file content, which will be written to the file system.



## Generator configuration from `prisma.yml`

Generators are being configured by the property `generate` in the `prisma.yml`.

This is how the `prisma.yml` for `generate` looks like at the time of this writing:

```yaml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466
datamodel: datamodel.prisma

generate:
  - generator: typescript-client
    output: ./src/generated/client
```

The advantage of this syntax is, that one generator could be referenced to multiple times. The disadvantage however is, that we have redundancy and we need to keep the indentation for the objects in the array in check. For the use-case that only one generator will be used, we optionally allow the inlining of the first generator:

```yaml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466
datamodel: datamodel.prisma

generate:
  generator: typescript-client
  output: ./src/generated/client
```



## Generator resolution

When referring to `typescript-client` as in the above `prisma.yml` example, the Prisma CLI now needs to decide in runtime how to resolve the generator implementation. This is the proposed order of resolution:

1. Try to find the generator in the list of **predefined generators** (including `typescript-client`), which are shipped with the Prisma SDK
2. Try to find a **node module** with the name of the generator, take as the base directory the directory of the `prisma.yml`
3. Try to **spawn a new process** which runs the generator as a command. This means that generator names like `./generator/java-generator --run` should be possible. Note, that yaml keys with spaces are even possible without quotes:

```yaml
generate:
  ./generators/java-generator --run:
    output: ./src/generated/client
    flavor: redundant
  "./with-quotes/it-may/be-easier/to --read":
    output: ./src/generated/client
    flavor: generics
```



## Generator interface

The following information should be communicated from the generator to the CLI:

- **Reserved names**, which are not allowed as model names in the datamodel. These can e.g. be names like `Prisma` or `AtLeastOne` for the TypeScript generator.
- **Accepted arguments**, which the generator knows to handle

When the generators then are called, this needs to be communicated from the CLI to the generator:

- The **GraphQL API Schema**
- The **env var strings** for the `secret` and the `endpoint` defined in the `prisma.yml`, because these values need to be substituted in runtime by the specific generator.
- **Prisma-specific model information**, which can't be expressed with a GraphQL Schema. This could for example be the information, if a type is an embedded type or not.
- The **parameters** provided by in the `prisma.yml`



### TypeScript

A generator, which is implemented in TypeScript, has to adhere to the following convention:

The generator name equals the npm package name. That means if the generator is called `my-typescript-generator` in the `prisma.yml`, then that's the name of the npm package that this generator has to live in.

The package should have a default export of a class, that extends the `Generator` class of the `prisma-generator` package, which will be a package including the default generators and some other useful utility functions.

The basic `Generator` class looks like this:

```ts
import { GraphQLSchema } from 'graphql'
import { IGQLType } from 'prisma-datamodel'
import * as fs from 'fs'

export interface GeneratorInput<Parameters = any> {
  /**
   * The graphql-js schema instance. The schema is the generated API Schema, that is
   * being generated based on the datamodel.
   */
  schema: GraphQLSchema
  /**
   * The ast representation of all models, including information like `isEmbedded`
   */
  internalTypes: IGQLType[]
  /**
   * The raw string of the endpoint as provided in the prisma.yml.
   * This may contain env var interpolation statements like ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
   */
  endpoint: string
  /**
   * The raw string of the secret as provided in the prisma.yml.
   * This may contain env var interpolation statements like ${env:PRISMA_SECRET}
   */
  secret: string
  /**
   * The parameters provided in the prisma.yml for this generator, converted from yaml to json.
   */
  parameters: Parameters
}

/**
 * FileMap is a mapping from file name to file content.
 * Folders will automatically be created when they don't exist already.
 * The paths of files will be created relative to the prisma.yml
 */
export interface FileMap {
  [fileName: string]: string
}

export type RenderOutput = FileMap | string

export abstract class Generator {
  protected input: GeneratorInput

  public static reservedTypes = ['Prisma']

  constructor(input: GeneratorInput) {
    this.input = input
  }

  public abstract render(): RenderOutput
  public saveToFS(output: RenderOutput) {
    //...
  }
}

```

A concrete user implementation of a generator could look like this:

```ts
import { Generator, GeneratorInput } from './Generator'
import { print } from 'graphql'

export interface Parameters {
  output: string
}

export default class ExampleGenerator extends Generator {
  constructor(input: GeneratorInput<Parameters>) {
    super(input)
  }
  render() {
    return print(this.input.schema)
  }
}

```



The CLI could help generators to check the input. This could be done with a convention, that the parameteres provided in the `prisma.yml` will be checked against the exported type `Parameters`. This could for example be achieved with [`typescript-json-schema`](https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema), which can convert a TypeScript type definition into a json schema.

The reserved names for models can be expressed through the static property `reservedTypes` as an array.



### Non-TypeScript

In order to inject the JSON data for the generators, we propose to inject one line of JSON via stdin.

This is a standard protocol, that every programming language can handle.

As the non-TypeScript generators can potentially be binary based so that no information can be read from them, the only way to communicate information from the binary to the CLI would be via an API that is being agreed on. However, the two use-cases of having **reserved words** and **arguments typed** are optional and nice to have. The easier approach is, that the generators handle these cases on their own.

The JSON format will look like this:

```ts
export interface GeneratorInput {
  /**
   * The schema SDL string representing the API Schema, which is being generated based on the datamodel.
   */
  schema: string
  /**
   * The ast representation of all models, including information like `isEmbedded`
   */
  internalTypes: IGQLType[]
  /**
   * The raw string of the endpoint as provided in the prisma.yml.
   * This may contain env var interpolation statements like ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
   */
  endpoint: string
  /**
   * The raw string of the secret as provided in the prisma.yml.
   * This may contain env var interpolation statements like ${env:PRISMA_SECRET}
   */
  secret: string
  /**
   * The parameters provided in the prisma.yml for this generator, converted from yaml to json.
   */
  parameters: any
}

```





## Inclusion in the Prisma SDK

A feature, that more and more users have requested, is the possibility to access the functionality exposed by the Prisma CLI from a programmatic API.

This section outlines how the generator API fits into the SDK and how the SDK will roughly look like. As soon as we have the SDK specced out in more detail, we will update this section.

The current assumption is, that the CLI will ship the Prisma native image binary, which right now is about 91mb in size, 27mb zipped. The Prisma CLI will still be available with under the `prisma` package name. One possibility could be to let this npm package also expose all SDK functionality, including the generator class and utilities needed to implement a TypeScript-based generator. However, as this would add an unnecessary, tremendous overhead to the package size of each generator, it probably makes more sense to package SDK-related code in a separate package. While it's not yet clear, if the Prisma binary should be part of the SDK, one thing is clear, which is that we can package all generator related logic into one package, for example `prisma-generate`. This package still could be a depenency of the Prisma SDK and eventually reexposed, if it makes sense.



# Drawbacks

- There is an inconsistency between TypeScript and non-TypeScript generators in the spec, in that the TypeScript generators are able to communicate reserved words and typings for the arguments. Thus the TypeScript generators don't have the responsibilty to check for the resulting error cases, while the non-TypeScript generators have to.

  

# Alternatives

- A declarative API always is more limited than an imperative one. We could for example provide a .js or .ts config  file, in which users can create generator statements more dynamic. Right now there is no reason to do so, as the prisma.yml already allows injection of env vars, which gives some level of flexibility.

  

# Adoption strategy

The proposal itself is a non-breaking change for the core generators. While the internal implementation while change significantly, users will not see any difference.



# How we teach this

The usage of generators has already great resources. The part, that needs more attention is the new possibility for developers to create their on clients. This needs examples and tutorials both for TypeScript and non-TypeScript languages, which implement simplified versions of the current client API.



# Unresolved questions

- [ ] The Prisma SDK still needs to be specced out, but as already discussed in `Inclusion in Prisma SDK`, it is very unlikely that  there will be any significant findings from the Prisma SDK, which will change this spec, as this area is fairly isolated.
- [ ] We should come up with better terminology instead of "TypeScript" and "Non-TypeScript" for the different ways of implementing a generator.
- [ ] Official generators (see [PR comment](https://github.com/prisma/rfcs/pull/4#issuecomment-462790202))
- [ ] Output location for generated files should be in `node_modules` (`$GOPATH or similar) by default
